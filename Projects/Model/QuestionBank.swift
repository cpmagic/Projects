It is so far away that light from the Sun, traveling at a speed of 186,000 miles per second, takes about 8 minutes to reach us. The Earth does not travel around the Sun in a perfect circle. This means that the distance between Earth and the Sun changes during a year. This distance also defines the AU or Astronomical Unit. The Earth is roughly 1 AU from the Sun.", trueFalse: true, questionImage: "SunDistance"))
